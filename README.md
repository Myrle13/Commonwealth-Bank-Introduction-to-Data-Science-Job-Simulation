## The first task is to use the provided “CSV Data Set”  of transactions at a supermarket and analyse the data to answer some questions.
InsightSpark wants to access our data to perform some analysis across Australian supermarkets. Before this can happen, I need you to perform some analysis on the provided CSV data set to answer the following questions:

Across locations, how many apples were purchased in cash?
How much total cash was spent on these apples?
Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?
## The second task focuses on anonymising a data set of sensitive customer information. Must preserve the utility and valuable information within the dataset while anonymising any personal or sensitive information.
Provided you with a data set named “mobile_customers.csv.” This contains information about customers that have signed up for the mobile app in the last three years.
Anonymise this data to hide personal details while preserving any useful information for the data scientists at InsightSpark.
